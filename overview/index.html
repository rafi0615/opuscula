<h2 id="history-of-the-journal">History of the journal</h2>
<p>Opuscula Mathematica was founded in 1937 by Professor Antoni Hoborski, an outstanding mathematician, the first Rector Magnificus of the Mining Academy (currently AGH University of Krakow), a co-establisher of the Polish Mathematical Society. Since 1968 the journal has been published at various times, first as Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii G√≥rniczo-Hutniczej im. Stanis≈Çawa Staszica, Opuscula Mathematica (Scientific Bulletins of the University of Mining and Metallurgy, Opuscula Mathematica) but in 1994 editors decided to return to its original name Opuscula Mathematica. In the years 1985 to 2004 the journal was published annually, from 2005 to 2007 biannually, then from 2008 to 2014 quarterly. Since 2015 the journal has been published 6 times per year.</p>
<h4 id="professor-antoni-hoborski">Professor Antoni Hoborski</h4>
<p>Professor Antoni Hoborski was born in 1879 in Tarn√≥w. He graduated from high school in Tarn√≥w in 1897 and continued his education in mathematics at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. After completing his studies in 1901, he worked for eighteen years as a high school teacher in Krak√≥w, Tarn√≥w, and Nowy SƒÖcz. In 1908, he received his PhD from the Jagiellonian University under the supervision of Prof. S. Zaremba. Between 1908 and 1910, he studied abroad, and in 1909, he was awarded a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mathematics from the Sorbonne in Paris. He also studied in G√∂ttingen from 1909 to 1910, focusing on the calculus of variations, and attended lectures by Klein and Hilbert.</p>
<p>In 1911, he was appointed as a contracted lecturer at the Jagiellonian University. That year, he was awarded a degree after defending his habilitation thesis titled &ldquo;About Some Applications of the Minimal Value Rule&rdquo;. In 1919, he became the first professor at the newly established Academy of Mining in Krak√≥w, where he served as the first rector and, from that year, also as the dean of the Mining Faculty. He organized the School of Geometry and participated in establishing the Polish Mathematical Society in 1919.</p>
<p>In 1921, he was granted the title of professor by the Jagiellonian University. In 1925, the Department of Mathematics offered him the chair, but he declined the offer; however, he did give several lectures there, primarily on differential geometry. He published 66 scientific papers, including seven scripts and seven textbooks. His textbook &ldquo;Theory of Planes&rdquo; featured the first Polish lecture on tensor calculus, although the book was left incomplete due to his sudden death. His textbook &ldquo;Theory of Curves&rdquo; (1933), which innovatively applied the vector method, was a significant contribution to mathematical literature of the time.</p>
<p>In 1939, his editorial and scientific activities were interrupted by the war. Antoni Hoborski died as a martyr in Konzentrationslager Sachsenhausen. To commemorate Professor Hoborski, the cover of each issue of Opuscula Mathematica includes his picture.</p>
