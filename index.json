    "abstract": "A graph $G$ whose vertex set can be partitioned into a total dominating set and an independent dominating set is called a TI-graph. There exist infinite families of graphs that are not TI-graphs. We define the TI-augmentation number $\\text{ti}(G)$ of a graph $G$ to be the minimum number of edges that must be added to $G$ to ensure that the resulting graph is a TI-graph. We show that every tree $T$ of order $n \\geq 5$ satisfies $\\text{ti}(T) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}n$. We prove that if $G$ is a bipartite graph of order $n$ with minimum degree $\\delta(G) \\geq 3$, then $\\text{ti}(G) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}n$, and if $G$ is a cubic graph of order $n$, then $\\text{ti}(G) \\leq \\frac{1}{3}n$. We conjecture that $\\text{ti}(G) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}n$ for all graphs $G$ of order $n$ with $\\delta(G) \\geq 3$, and show that there exist connected graphs $G$ of sufficiently large order $n$ with $\\delta(G) \\geq 3$ such that $\\text{ti}(T) \\geq (\\frac{1}{6} - \\epsilon)n$ for any given $\\epsilon \u003e 0$.",
