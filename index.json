    "abstract": "We prove that in a connected graph, the distances between non-cut vertices are odd if and only if it is the line graph of a strong unique independence tree. We then show that any such tree can be inductively constructed from stars using a simple operation. Further, we study the connected graphs in which the distances between non-cut vertices are even (shortly, NCE-graphs). Our main results on NCE-graphs are the following: we give a criterion of NCE-graphs, show that any bipartite graph is an induced subgraph of an NCE-graph, characterize NCE-graphs with exactly two leaves, characterize graphs that can be subdivided to NCE-graphs, and provide a characterization for NCE-graphs which are maximal with respect to the edge addition operation.",

In this work, we investigate such closure results for arbitrarily partitionable graphs, a weakening of Hamiltonian graphs being those graphs that can be partitioned into arbitrarily many connected graphs of arbitrary orders. Among other results, we establish closure results for arbitrary partitions into connected graphs of order at most 3, for arbitrary partitions into connected graphs of order exactly any \\(\\lambda\\), and for the property of being arbitrarily partitionable in full.",

    "abstract": "We construct the Lie algebra of extended symmetry group for the Monge-Ampere type Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equation. This algebra includes novel generators that are unobtainable within the framework of the classical Lie approach and correspond to non-point group transformation of dependent and independent variables. The expansion of symmetry is achieved by introducing new variables through second-order derivatives of the dependent variable. By integrating the Lie equations, we derive transformations that enable the generation of new solutions to the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equation from a known one. These transformations yield formulas for obtaining new solutions in implicit form and Bäcklund-type transformations for the nonlinear associativity equations. We also demonstrate that, in the case under study, introducing a substitution of variables via third-order derivatives, as previously used in the literature, does not yield generators of non-point transformations. Instead, this approach produces only the Lie groups of classical point transformations. Furthermore, we perform a group reduction of partial differential equations in two independent variables to a system of ordinary differential equations. This reduction leads to the explicit solution of the fully nonlinear differential equation. Notably, the symmetry group of non-point transformations expands significantly when this method is applied to the second-order differential equation, resulting in a corresponding infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. Finally, we show that auxiliary variables can be systematically derived within the framework of a generalized approach to symmetry reduction of differential equations.",
