  <h1 class="TitleContainer">Instruction for Authors - Opuscula Mathematica</h1>
  <div class="instructions-content">
    <h3 id="submission-of-manuscript">Submission of manuscript</h3>
<p>To submit a paper for publication, authors should send a PDF file by email to:
<a href="mailto:opuscula@agh.edu.pl">opuscula@agh.edu.pl</a></p>
<p>The primary criteria for accepting papers submitted for publication are:</p>
<ul>
<li>-clarity of exposition,</li>
<li>-readability,</li>
<li>-timeliness of the contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only original papers will be considered. Manuscripts are accepted for review with the understanding that the same work has not been and will not be submitted elsewhere. Submission for publication must be approved by all authors and by the institution where the work was conducted. Furthermore, any person cited as a source of personal communications must have approved such a citation. Written authorization may be required at the editor&rsquo;s discretion. Articles and any other material published in Opuscula Mathematica represent the opinions of the author(s) and should not be construed as reflecting the opinions of the editor. No more than two papers will be considered or published by the same author or co-author within a one-year period.</p>
<p>Authors of papers accepted for publication are kindly requested to send the LaTeX or AMS-TeX files by email to:
<a href="mailto:opuscula@agh.edu.pl">opuscula@agh.edu.pl</a></p>
<h4 id="there-are-no-fees-for-submitting-processing-or-publishing-an-article-in-opuscula-mathematica">There are no fees for submitting, processing or publishing an article in Opuscula Mathematica.</h4>
<h3 id="latex-template-file">LaTeX template file</h3>
<p>It is highly recommended to use the following LaTeX template <a href="https://www.opuscula.agh.edu.pl/OpusculaMath-template.tex">(download file)</a> to prepare your manuscript for publication in Opuscula Mathematica. While using this file is optional, it can expedite the editorial process after manuscript acceptance.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-of-manuscript">Preparation of manuscript</h3>
<p>Manuscripts must be clearly written in English. Incorrect use of the language is not acceptable. Footnotes and unusual symbols should be avoided. It is strongly recommended to limit the length of a manuscript to fewer than 25 pages.</p>
<p><strong>Title page</strong> (page 1). The title page should include the article title, the names of all authors listed in alphabetical order (without affiliations, unless otherwise specified), and an abstract. The abstract must be a single paragraph of fewer than 150 words summarizing the main findings of the paper. Since abstracts are often presented separately, avoid referencing numbered items in the paper or using uncommon abbreviations. Any references cited in the abstract should be provided in full. Following the abstract, include a list of up to 10 keywords that will assist with indexing or searching, as well as the relevant <a href="https://zbmath.org/static/msc2020.pdf">2020 Mathematics Subject Classification codes.</a></p>
<p><strong>Sections.</strong> An article should be divided into numbered sections and subsections (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.). Each subsection may have a brief heading.</p>
<p><strong>Equations.</strong> Equations should be typewritten, with the numbers for displayed equations placed in parentheses at the right margin. References to equations should follow the format &lsquo;&rsquo;equation (3.1)&rsquo;&rsquo; or simply &lsquo;&rsquo;(3.1).&rsquo;&rsquo; Automatic numbering of equations is strongly preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Figures.</strong> Figures must be prepared in a form suitable for direct reproduction. If complicated figures or diagrams are used, the corresponding graphic files should be included, preferably in eps format. Digital artwork of at least 300 dpi resolution is accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgements.</strong> Acknowledgements, if applicable, should be placed before the references.</p>
<p><strong>References.</strong> Authors should use a numbered referencing style. References should be arranged in alphabetical-chronological order, and the list should minimize the use of author macros. Italics are preferred for titles of books and journals. The following general rules also apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>-in journal titles, capitalize the first letter of the first word,</li>
<li>-in book titles, capitalize the first letter of each word, except for &lsquo;&lsquo;and&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;of&rsquo;&rsquo;, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abbreviations for journal names and references should adhere <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/msnhtml/serials.pdf">to the standard format established by Mathematical Reviews.</a> Every reference cited in the text must appear in the reference list, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For example, the reference list begins with: \begin{thebibliography}{widest-label}.
Each reference is then added as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>-for books:<br>
&lsquo;&rsquo;\bibitem{ref1} A.A. Author, \textit{Title of the Book}, Name of Press, Place of Publication, 2020.&rsquo;&rsquo;</li>
<li>-for papers:<br>
&lsquo;&rsquo;\bibitem{ref2} A.A. Author, \textit{Title of the paper}, Abbreviation of Journal Title \textbf{4} (2020), 21&ndash;49.&rsquo;&rsquo;</li>
<li>or</li>
<li>&lsquo;&rsquo;\bibitem{ref3} A.A. Author1, B.B. Author2, \textit{Title of the paper}, Abbreviation of Journal Title \textbf{4} (2020), 21&ndash;49.&rsquo;&rsquo;</li>
<li>if a given article has more than one author.</li>
<li>To end the bibliography, type: \end{thebibliography}.</li>
<li>References in the text should be cited by using: &lsquo;&rsquo;\cite{ref1}&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&rsquo;\cite{ref1,ref2,ref3}&rsquo;&rsquo;. This produces [1] or [1,2,3] in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a reference list is provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li>-book:
[1] J.B. Conway, A Course in Functional Analysis, Springer, New York, 1990.</li>
<li>-journal article:

</ul>
<p><strong>Affiliations.</strong> At the end of the paper (after the references), the author should provide complete affiliations and the address for manuscript correspondence (including email and physical address).</p>
<h3 id="review-procedure">Review procedure</h3>
<p>Any manuscripts received for review will be treated as confidential documents. They are initially evaluated by the editors to determine whether they merit full external review. Reviewers for Opuscula Mathematica are selected from the broader scientific community by the editors based on their expertise in the field. All papers are reviewed in a single-blind manner, meaning that reviewer names are anonymized, and the Journal does not disclose their identities to the authors. Reviewers are chosen in a way that ensures any potential conflicts of interest (including financial, personal, or other relationships) between them and the authors are disclosed. The corresponding author is then informed of the editorial decision via email. It is uncommon for submitted manuscripts to be accepted without the need for revision. Please note that a request for revision does not guarantee acceptance. The current acceptance rate for considered papers is approximately 15 percent.</p>
<h3 id="copyright-declaration">Copyright declaration</h3>
<p>After a paper is accepted for publication, the authors are asked to sign a copyright declaration form with the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
